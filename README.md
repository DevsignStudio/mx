###What is Materilex?

Materilex is backbone framework for developing Material Design Language by Google using [Meteor](http://meteor.com/). Find out more about Meteor from their official website [here](http://meteor.com/).

###Why choose Meteor for develop Materilex?

Meteor team aim to create real-time application across all the devices & browsers that connect to application. When we want to start development of Materilex, we create this application in Laravel but the main issue is real-time application support. We need to start from the scratch if we want to create real-time backbone framework but when we found out about Meteor, our greatest concern about this issue is now solve. We can concentrate in UI & UX design of Google Material Design and improve the development withour worry with real-time support in our framework.
